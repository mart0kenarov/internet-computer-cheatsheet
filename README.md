# DFX Cheat Sheet for the Internet Computer

This repository contains a short PDF file offering a compact, one- or two-page cheat sheet for the DFX command-line tool. DFX is the primary interface for creating, building, and deploying applications on the Internet Computer (IC). The cheat sheet includes:

- **Project Initialization** (with `dfx new`)
- **Starting and Stopping a Local Replica** (`dfx start`, `dfx stop`)
- **Canister Management** (`dfx canister` subcommands)
- **Identity & Cycle Management** (`dfx identity`, `dfx cycles`)
- **Network and Deployment Options** (local vs. mainnet, `dfx deploy`, `dfx ping`)
- **Wallet and Ledger Commands** for more advanced scenarios

## Purpose

The goal of this cheat sheet is to serve as an immediate reference for commonly used DFX commands without requiring you to switch between terminals and extensive documentation. It’s especially helpful for developers who are already familiar with DFX basics and need a quick way to look up command syntax and options.

## How to Use

1. **Download the PDF** from this repository.  
2. **Keep it handy** in your development environment or reference it while working.  
3. **Look up commands** quickly when setting up new projects, deploying canisters, or managing identities.
